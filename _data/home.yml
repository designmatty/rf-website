    capability-statement: >-
      The biggest obstacle to leveraging machine learning is the absence of
      training data. Our clients can label and validate images quickly, manage
      large queues of annotation and validation tasks, and improve machine
      learning model findings to improve performance. No capacity to label data?
      No problem - our team can do that too.

      “Azavea built a highly scalable and robust machine learning pipeline that
      allows us to produce high accuracy, high resolution cropland maps for all
      of Ghana. Their effort in developing this went far above and beyond what
      we all initially imagined would be the scope of effort, and is a really
      critical contribution to our project’s success.”
