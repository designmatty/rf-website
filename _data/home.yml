      The biggest obstacle to leveraging machine learning is the absence of
      high-quality training data. Our clients can label and validate images
      quickly, manage large queues, and improve model performance easily. Or you
      can leave the work to us.

      “Azavea built a highly scalable and robust machine learning pipeline that
      allows us to produce high accuracy, high resolution cropland maps for all
      of Ghana. Their effort in developing this went far above and beyond what
      we all initially imagined would be the scope of effort, and is a really
      critical contribution to our project’s success.”
