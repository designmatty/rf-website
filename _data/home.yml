about-title: We are Raster Foundry
about-body: >-
  Raster Foundry enables companies using earth observation imagery to organize
  vast quantities of data, create custom analyses, and use machine learning
  techniques to extract insights. Our customers leverage our expertise to
  monitor physical assets to ensure long-term maintenance and protection and
  detect changes in the natural environment, both at home and abroad. At its
  core, Raster Foundry is an open source tool based on years of research and
  gives customers the greatest analysis capabilities without sacrificing
  performance.

capabilities-title: We've got everything you need to manage and analyze your imagery
capabilities:
  - capability-icon: far fa-database
    capability-statement: >-
      Our customers upload thousands of images per day. Raster Foundry allows
      them to process remotely sensed data rapidly to create maps and custom
      analysis seamlessly.

      The biggest obstacle to leveraging machine learning is the absence of
      training data. Using our  Annotate tool, our clients can label and
      validate images quickly, and manage large queues of annotation and
      validation tasks. They can also verify the machine learning models
      findings to improve performance. No capacity to label data? No problem -
      our team can do that too.
    capability-title: Annotation

      Using Raster Vision, our open source library for applying computer vision
      and machine learning techniques to Earth observation imagery, Raster
      Foundry can perform object detection, chip classification, semantic and
      instance segmentation operations.

      We've built custom internal business process applications for some of our
      larger clients. We serve as consultants and long-term maintainers for
      some.

      We've developed this machine learning focused open source library and
      intend to maintain it in the long-term. As new research problems arise, we
      aim to update the library with the components necessary to address them,
      enabling us to remain on the cutting edge of this technology.
