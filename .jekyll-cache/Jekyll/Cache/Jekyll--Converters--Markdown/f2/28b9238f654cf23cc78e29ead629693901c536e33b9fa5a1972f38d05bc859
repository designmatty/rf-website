<p>Over the past decade, the rise of commercial drone technology and proliferation of affordable satellite imagery has enabled a new paradigm of quantitative monitoring and assessment of valuable infrastructure at scale.</p>

<p>Whether you are working to prevent third-party construction activity along thousands of miles of pipeline right of way or trying to quantify the structural integrity of a single bridge, drone and satellite data is an invaluable resource for modern infrastructure managers. By combining imagery with advanced machine learning techniques, industry leaders are now able to get a more complete picture of the condition of their assets than ever before. Having timely, quantitative data about assets enables better decision-making when it comes to allocating resources and reducing risk across the entire enterprise.</p>
